The **hue** parameter in the `manipulate_image`() function is used to shift the hue values of the image, resulting in different color schemes. The hue value is a float, typically ranging from -1 to 1, where 0 means no change, positive values shift the hue clockwise in the color wheel, and negative values shift the hue counterclockwise.

Hue values in color space are typically represented in a circular form, often called a "color wheel." The color wheel is divided into 360 degrees, with different colors associated with different angle values:

**Red**: 0 degrees (or 360 degrees)
**Yellow**: 60 degrees
**Green**: 120 degrees
**Cyan**: 180 degrees
**Blue**: 240 degrees
**Magenta**: 300 degrees

n the manipulate_image() function, we scale the hue parameter from -1 to 1 to cover the entire range of hue values. When the hue parameter is set to a specific value, the hue values in the image are shifted by that fraction of the full hue range (360 degrees).

For example:

- A hue value of 0.5 would shift the hue values by 180 degrees clockwise in the color wheel, effectively changing red to cyan, green to magenta, and blue to yellow.
- A hue value of -0.5 would shift the hue values by 180 degrees counterclockwise in the color wheel, effectively changing red to cyan, green to magenta, and blue to yellow (same as the previous example, since the shift is by 180 degrees).
- A hue value of 0.33 would shift the hue values by 120 degrees clockwise in the color wheel, effectively changing red to green, green to blue, and blue to red.
- A hue value of -0.25 would shift the hue values by 90 degrees counterclockwise in the color wheel, effectively changing red to yellow, green to cyan, and blue to magenta.


You can experiment with different hue values to achieve various color schemes for your image. Keep in mind that the color shifts might be more complex in real images, as they contain a mix of colors and may not always result in the exact colors mentioned in the examples.
